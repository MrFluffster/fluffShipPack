fluffships_buffalomkiv,SHIP,"A ramshackle Buffalo hull, with its cargo holds stripped away and wholly repurposed to house loaders and missiles for the salvaged Reaper torpedo launchers. For all intents and purposes, it is a deathtrap for the crew unfortunate or foolish enough to man it, crafted with a singular purpose in mind. And yet, for Pathers always desperate for more firepower and blind to the ship's deadly faults in their hatred of Moloch it is a non-issue, making it a perfect instrument of destruction to utilize in their fleets. However, other than the overkill armaments hastily welded onto the hull, it is still a Buffalo. One of the few to be only piloted with a death wish.",,,
fluffships_bielik,SHIP,"A niche hit-and-run ship with powerful engines, capable of quickly delivering burst damage on target, and dangerous in squadrons picking off unsupported vessels. Their lackluster flux core however make them all but a terrible choice for a frontline fighter, lacking in staying power and flux dissipation crucial in longer standoffs.",,,
fluffships_buffaloex,SHIP,"First an aggressively marketed novelty, now nothing more than an uncommon aftermarket modification, as it quickly became evident that you're way better served by getting yourself a Colossus... This Buffalo has been significantly extended, nearly doubling its capacity, at the cost of extra mass making the drive consume more fuel, and turning it into a slower, bigger target in a combat situation. Talk about compensating for something. However, as a minor positive, it's been fitted with more mounts, and the logistics to support them. Just in case... you really wanted something like that.",,,
fluffships_collier,SHIP,"The Collier is a variation of the classic freighter turned into an equally combat-capable mining platform, built for the various dangers and obvious needs of the frontier. With a hardwired blaster and a squadron of borer drones, it's equally able at cracking rocks as it is at cracking hulls of ill-equipped raiders hoping for easy loot, able to bring plenty of its haul home. Although against specialized combat vessels, it will be quickly found wanting.",,,
fluffships_panhandler,SHIP,"In a pinch, Panhandler can fend off smaller attackers, but where it truly feels at home is mining. With its array of mining lasers and drones, it can quickly dig out useful ores out of lumps of stellar dust and dirt. In these times, those tools also speed salvage operations up significantly, coming in handy for all salvagers and prospectors.",,,
fluffships_custodian,SHIP,"A bulbous form belies the defensive strength of the Custodian, with intense shield strength, backed by a considerable armament. While slow and ponderous, it can withstand massive amounts of punishment, ensured to last through the heaviest of bombardments intact, though, it can struggle to smaller, more nimble foes capable of skirting around it.

During the design and testing phases of the Custodian, a particularly vast amount of focus was placed into optimization of the shield generators, with every measure taken to make it more effective, from reducing weapon space for additional shielding to siphoning power from the engines.",,,
fluffships_stormbringer,SHIP,"Where there's storm, there's thunder, and Stormbringer comes to the field packing 16 whooping barrels of lightning with it. Each of the fighters is outfitted with the Lightstorm box, delivering a rapid fragmentation barrage meant to put an end to any frigate unfortunate to fly into its range. However, even with the specialized autoloaders, with the slowly reloading nature of the Lightstorm box it's unable to sustain any sort of pressure, serving more as a fighter to finish the work of other ships",,,
fluffships_collier_rg,SHIP,"A haphazardly-modified set of mining beams and devices were looked upon with promise by the Revolutionaries, and converted into a powerful beam, burning through adversaries with revolutionary fervor",,,
fluffships_atlasmk5,SHIP,"A fast, nimble battlecruiser, the Atlas Mk.5 can move quick, and provide solid support through fighters, though any captain should be mindful of the ship's condition, due to the inherent fragility and armor limitation issues that come with the Atlas's frame.

Desperate times call for desperate measures, and in the Persean Sector, times are assuredly desperate. While ersatz refits of civilian hauling craft to combat-capable line ships is a task generally left to the pirates or the Hegemony, the (allegedly) substance-abusing engineers on Kazeron decided to concoct a more competent military refit of the Atlas, forming it into a ship comparable - though much superior - to the Atlas Mk.2",,,
fluffships_firecrow,SHIP,"An attack craft based on the legendary civilian shuttle from Fabrique Orbitale, the Firecrow functions effectively as a support or strike craft, both groundside and in orbit, despite overall fragility. Such a capable strike craft could be used for supporting invaders through bombardment of hard targets with it's Dickerson Pods, which are equally capable at shattering bunkers as they are shattering heavy ship armor.",,,
fluffships_crab,SHIP,"Often compared by amateur spacers and ship watchers to legendary Old Earth crustaceans of old tales, the Crab is an unbelievably old design - notably outdating the Onslaught - that to this day retains a considerable bite. What it has in combat power it lacks defensively, outdating modern shielding systems and composite armor materials by many decades, leaving it as a capable economic artillery choice.",,,
fluffships_steward,SHIP,"The Steward was developed by Tri-Tachyon shortly before the Collapse to keep up with the Monitor's extreme defensive potential without having to rely on external products. Possessing a large amount of turrets, intended primarily for point defence, paired with an advanced shield generator and active flare system, The Steward represents a capable defence platform that while not as durable as its competitor can very effectively screen a large area from missiles. One however should not expect it to stand its ground in offense.

Lengthy development time put into this hull has produced a powerful defensive frigate. Weapon systems have Delta-level AI integrated into their targeting systems in order to maximise efficiency against intended targets. Multiple Active Flare Launchers provide exceptional coverage for escorted ships, able to neutralize many missiles. ",,,

fluffships_strafedrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Engages all ship engines for an attack run. Provides a massive forward speed boost, while keeping the manouvering thrusters online for adjusting angle of attack. The ship runs the risk of full engine flameout on any significant collision.",Movement,Provides a massive speed boost at the expense of being unable to use shields. Collisions can cause a flameout while the system is active.,

fluffships_lightstormbox,WEAPON,"A unique weapon capable of churning out terrifying firepower, the Storm Box utilizes a stack of 16 single-use gun barrels with superposed loads, allowing for firerate unmatched by weapons in its category. However the nature of this system's loading method means that the gun must replace its disposable barrels after each volley, resulting in a rather lengthy reload. Woe betide the ship unlucky to be caught in the entirety of its rainfall.",,,

fluffships_lightrailmg,WEAPON,"Having found success as a makeshift weapon for frigates, an effort was made to turn light machine guns into something more than just a point defence weapon, giving birth to the light machine-railgun. Having removed the point defence subroutines and upgrading the calibre of weapons to be more fitting for harrassing shielded vessels, it is a rather respectable short-ranged weapon, finding its home on quick ships able to deliver sustained fire where needed most. It is still worth remembering that at heart, the light machine-railgun is still nothing more than an iteration of machinegun and won't stand toe to toe with more specialized weapons.",,,
fluffships_commielaser,WEAPON,"The Collier's hardwired mining tools were converted into a beam capable of shredding ship hulls and disrupting systems, burning hot like its crew's revolutionary spirit.",,,
