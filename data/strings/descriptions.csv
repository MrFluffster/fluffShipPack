fluffships_buffalomkiv,SHIP,"A Buffalo with its cargo holds stripped away and replaced with salvaged Reaper torpedo launchers. While potentially powerful, it is still a Buffalo in every other way and only someone with a death wish would fly one.",,,

fluffships_mixedbuffalo,SHIP,"A modified Buffalo, capable of being both a tanker and a freighter for a captain on a budget, though not as good as a dedicated ship.",,,
