fluffships_buffaloex,SHIP,"An uncommon aftermarket modifications, as it is usually better to just buy a Colossus, this Buffalo has been extended significantly, nearly doubling its capacity. The extra mass makes the drive consume more fuel, and much slower in a combat situation.",,,

However the nature of this system means that the gun must replace its disposable barrells after each volley, causing a lengthy reload.",,,
