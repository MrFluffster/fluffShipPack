fluffships_buffalomkiv,SHIP,"A ramshackle Buffalo hull, with its cargo holds stripped away and wholly repurposed to house loaders and missiles for the salvaged Reaper torpedo launchers. For all intents and purposes, it is a deathtrap for the crew unfortunate or foolish enough to man it, crafted with a singular purpose in mind. And yet, for Pathers always desperate for more firepower and blind to the ship's deadly faults in their hatred of Moloch it is a non-issue, making it a perfect instrument of destruction to utilize in their fleets. However, other than the overkill armaments hastily welded onto the hull, it is still a Buffalo. One of the few to be only piloted with a death wish.",,,
fluffships_bielik,SHIP,"A niche hit-and-run ship with powerful engines, capable of quickly delivering burst damage on target, and dangerous in squadrons picking off unsupported vessels. Their lackluster flux core however make them all but a terrible choice for a frontline fighter, lacking in staying power and flux dissipation crucial in longer standoffs.",,,
fluffships_buffaloex,SHIP,"First an aggressively marketed novelty, now nothing more than an uncommon aftermarket modification, as it quickly became evident that you're way better served by getting yourself a Colossus... This Buffalo has been significantly extended, nearly doubling its capacity, at the cost of extra mass making the drive consume more fuel, and turning it into a slower, bigger target in a combat situation. Not to mention the hilarious length of it impairing the coverage of point defence systems on the sides. Talk about compensating for something.",,,
fluffships_symcondor,SHIP,"An extra wing has been sewed (back) onto the Condor, creating this ship. The increased carrier capacity comes at the cost of everything else being a bit worse, as the entirety of newly acquired room has been used for additional weaponry and fighter forges.",,,
fluffships_mixedbuffalo,SHIP,"A modified model of the trusty Buffalo, capable of being both a tanker and a freighter. Ideal for a captain on a tight budget, though obviously not as good as a dedicated ship for the purposes of either transport of fuel or cargo. Some of the flippant crew members manning these ships came up with less than flattering nicknames, owing to its rather unfortunate top view.",,,
fluffships_collier,SHIP,"The Collier is a variation of the classic freighter turned into an equally combat-capable mining platform, built for the various dangers and obvious needs of the frontier. With a hardwired blaster and a squadron of borer drones, it's equally able at cracking rocks as it is at cracking hulls of ill-equipped raiders hoping for easy loot, able to bring plenty of its haul home. Although against specialized combat vessels, it will be quickly found wanting.",,,
fluffships_lightstormbox,WEAPON,"A unique weapon capable of churning out terrifying firepower, the Storm Box utilizes a stack of 16 single-use gun barrels with superposed loads, allowing for firerate unmatched by weapons in its category. However the nature of this system's loading method means that the gun must replace its disposable barrels after each volley, resulting in a rather lengthy reload. Woe betide the ship unlucky to be caught in the entirety of its rainfall.",,,

However the nature of this system's loading method means that the gun must replace its disposable barrels after each volley, resulting in a rather lengthy reload. Woe betide the ship unlucky to be caught in the entirety of its rainfall.",,,
fluffships_lightrailmg,WEAPON,"Having found success as a makeshift weapon for frigates, an effort was made to turn light machine guns into something more than just a point defence weapon, giving birth to the light machine-railgun. Having removed the point defence subroutines and upgrading the calibre of weapons to be more fitting for harrassing shielded vessels, it is a rather respectable short-ranged weapon, finding its home on quick ships able to deliver sustained fire where needed most. It is still worth remembering that at heart, the light machine-railgun is still nothing more than an iteration of machinegun and won't stand toe to toe with more specialized weapons.",,,
fluffships_panhandler,SHIP,"In a pinch, Panhandler can fend off smaller attackers, but where it truly feels at home is mining. With its array of mining lasers and drones, it can quickly dig out useful ores out of lumps of stellar dust and dirt. In these times, those tools also speed salvage operations up significantly, coming in handy for all salvagers and prospectors.",,,
fluffships_stripesfalcon,SHIP,"TX-011 is a high-performing refit of the Falcon, with racing-grade engines, designed to rapidly engage and disengage with is powerful arsenal.

Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.",,,
fluffships_custodian,SHIP,"A bulbous form belies the defensive strength of the Custodian, with intense shield strength, backed by a considerable armament. While slow and ponderous, it can withstand massive amounts of punishment, ensured to last through the heaviest of bombardments intact, though, it can struggle to smaller, more nimble foes capable of skirting around it.

During the design and testing phases of the Custodian, a particularly vast amount of focus was placed into optimization of the shield generators, with every measure taken to make it more effective, from fixing the shield forward to siphoning power from the engines.",,,
fluffships_thunderbolt,SHIP,"With the great successes that the Thunder had as an long-distance interceptor, the contractors have been looking for a direct upgrade to the fighter's capacities, giving birth to Thunderbolt. The obvious naming convention very much implies no great changes to its role, however it does come with faster engines and better weapons to boot, giving it the much needed boost to keep buyers interested and an edge for ships capable of supporting its higher maintenance",,,
fluffships_stormbringer,SHIP,"Where there's storm, there's thunder, and Stormbringer comes to the field packing 16 whooping barrels of lightning with it. Each of the fighters is outfitted with the Lightstorm box, delivering a rapid fragmentation barrage meant to put an end to any frigate unfortunate to fly into its range. However, even with the specialized autoloaders, with the slowly reloading nature of the Lightstorm box it's unable to sustain any sort of pressure, serving more as a fighter to finish the work of other ships",,,
fluffships_commielaser,WEAPON,"The Collier's hardwired mining tools were converted into a beam capable of shredding ship hulls and disrupting systems, burning hot like its crew's revolutionary spirit.",,,
fluffships_collier_rg,SHIP,"A haphazardly-modified set of mining beams and devices were looked upon with promise by the Revolutionaries, and converted into a powerful beam, burning through adversaries with revolutionary fervor",,,
