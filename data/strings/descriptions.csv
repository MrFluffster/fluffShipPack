fluffships_buffalomkiv,SHIP,"A ramshackle Buffalo hull, with its cargo holds stripped away and wholly repurposed to house loaders and missiles for the salvaged Reaper torpedo launchers. For all intents and purposes, it is a deathtrap for the crew unfortunate or foolish enough to man it, crafted with a singular purpose in mind. And yet, for Pathers always desperate for more firepower and blind to the ship's deadly faults in their hatred of Moloch it is a non-issue, making it a perfect instrument of destruction to utilize in their fleets. However, other than the overkill armaments hastily welded onto the hull, it is still a Buffalo. One of the few to be only piloted with a death wish.",,,
fluffships_bielik,SHIP,"A niche hit-and-run ship with powerful engines, capable of quickly delivering burst damage on target, and dangerous in squadrons picking off unsupported vessels. Their lackluster flux core however make them all but a terrible choice for a frontline fighter, lacking in staying power and flux dissipation crucial in longer standoffs.",,,
fluffships_buffaloex,SHIP,"First an aggressively marketed novelty, now nothing more than an uncommon aftermarket modification, as it quickly became evident that you're way better served by getting yourself a Colossus... This Buffalo has been significantly extended, nearly doubling its capacity, at the cost of extra mass making the drive consume more fuel, and turning it into a slower, bigger target in a combat situation. Not to mention the hilarious length of it impairing the coverage of point defence systems on the sides. Talk about compensating for something.",,,
fluffships_symcondor,SHIP,"An extra wing has been sewed (back) onto the Condor, creating this ship. The increased carrier capacity comes at the cost of everything else being a bit worse, as the entirety of newly acquired room has been used for additional weaponry and fighter forges.",,,
fluffships_mixedbuffalo,SHIP,"A modified model of the trusty Buffalo, capable of being both a tanker and a freighter. Ideal for a captain on a tight budget, though obviously not as good as a dedicated ship for the purposes of either transport of fuel or cargo. Some of the flippant crew members manning these ships came up with less than flattering nicknames, owing to its rather unfortunate top view.",,,
fluffships_collier,SHIP,"The Collier is a variation of the classic freighter turned into an equally combat-capable mining platform, built for the various dangers and obvious needs of the frontier. With a hardwired blaster and a squadron of borer drones, it's equally able at cracking rocks as it is at cracking hulls of ill-equipped raiders hoping for easy loot, able to bring plenty of its haul home. Although against specialized combat vessels, it will be quickly found wanting.",,,
fluffships_lightstormbox,WEAPON,"A unique weapon capable of churning out terrifying firepower, the Storm Box utilizes a stack of 16 single-use gun barrels with superposed loads, allowing for firerate unmatched by weapons in its category. However the nature of this system's loading method means that the gun must replace its disposable barrels after each volley, resulting in a rather lengthy reload. Woe betide the ship unlucky to be caught in the entirety of its rainfall.",,,
fluffships_lightrailmg,WEAPON,"Having found success as a makeshift weapon for frigates, an effort was made to turn light machine guns into something more than just a point defence weapon, giving birth to the light machine-railgun, as they called it. Having removed the point defence subroutines and upgrading the calibre of weapons to be more fitting for harrassing shielded vessels, it is a rather respectable short-ranged weapon, finding its home on quick ships able to deliver sustained fire where needed most. It is still worth remembering that at heart, the light machine-railgun is still nothing more than an iteration of machinegun and won't stand toe to toe with more specialized weapons.",,,
